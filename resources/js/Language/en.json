This agreement regulates the rules of transfer and work between the Agent/realtor – user of the EVON platform (hereinafter the \"Agent\") and the EVON company (hereinafter the \"Company\") when transferring a potential buyer Client to support and conduct transactions in Turkey.<br><br>2. This agreement is valid from the moment the Agent's personal Account is created on the website and until the Agent's account is deleted on the initiative of either party.<br><br>3. Under this agreement, the Agent transfers for a fee (the fact of transfer is the entry of the Client's contact details on the website by the Agent) to work with the Client, and the Company accepts, clarifies and transmits the Client's data to its partner – a licensed Real Estate Agency in Turkey (hereinafter referred to as the \"Partner\").<br><br>4. When transferring a Client, the Agent enters the following information about the client on the website: full name, phone number, messenger contacts, Information on the purpose and time of purchase, payment form and other comprehensive information.<br><br>5. Transferred are considered to be Clients with whom contact has been established, an initial consultation has been conducted, an initial selection of real estate has been made using the selections of the EVON website, purchase goals have been established during negotiations, the planned date of the transaction or arrival in Turkey to select real estate, the form of payment, a detailed description of the property in question.<br><br>6. Rules of payment and calculation of remuneration:<br>6.1. If the Client has not decided on a real estate object and he needs: to search for an object, real estate selection, comprehensive information about the Turkish real estate market, legal support of the transaction, translation services, full support and consultation at all stages of working with the seller, including: meeting in Turkey, showing objects, drafting all necessary documents for the transaction and payment, consulting on payment issues, international transfers, installments, as well as after-sales service (consultations on migration issues, repairs, furniture purchases, etc.), then the Agent's remuneration is 40% of the profit, minus all possible transaction costs (including transport, customer accommodation, taxes, etc.).<br>6.2. If the Client has decided on the real estate object and he needs: legal support of the transaction (preparation of all necessary documents for the transaction and payment), meeting the Client with accompanying him to the Seller, assistance in negotiations with the Seller, advice on payment and transfer of funds, translation services, then the Agent's remuneration is 75% of the profit, for deduction of all possible transaction costs (including transportation, customer accommodation, taxes, etc.). This condition applies to transferred customers who are willing to pay 100% of the cost of the object, without the use of installments and other forms of payment. If during the transaction the Client decides to change the form of payment (for example, to apply installments) or to change the object of purchase, the remuneration for such a Client will be calculated according to clause 6.1<br><br>7. The Agent has no right to require the Company and the Partner to provide the client with additional discounts, bonuses or gifts when buying real estate. If the Real Estate Agency provides such benefits to the client, their cost will be deducted from the total commission fee, unless otherwise agreed between the parties and will be the transaction costs.<br><br>8. The Agent can claim commission only from transactions with Clients whose contact details he has provided.<br><br>9. The basis for the payment of remuneration is:<br>- Conclusion of a contract for the purchase and sale of real estate by the Client with the participation of a Partner.<br>- The client fulfills all payment obligations under the contract of sale of real estate.<br>- The Company received a commission from the Seller or Partner.<br><br>10. Payment of the commission fee to the Agent will be made within 15 working days after receiving the commission fee from the seller or Partner in cash or to the Agent's account in the Russian Federation. Payment to the account is made in rubles at the current exchange rate at the time of transfer. Possible costs/commissions for the transfer and conversion are paid by the Agent. If the Commission fee is not received in full (for example, according to the seller's condition in installments), the Company transfers the remuneration to the Agent in part, in proportion to the profit received.<br><br>11. The Agent undertakes not to transfer the Client's contacts to any other Agency/agent in Turkey from the moment the Client's data is entered on the Company's website.<br><br>12. The Company undertakes to maintain confidentiality of the transferred Customer contacts and not to transfer them to third parties, with the exception of the Partner.<br><br>13. The Company strongly recommends broadcasting to the Client about the need for priority cooperation with the Company and the Partner for better interaction of all parties to the agreement and successful transactions.<br><br>14. If the Agent uses the customer addition service within the framework of the Agreement, then in this way, he confirms that:<br>- Have fully read this Agreement;<br>- Fully understands the full meaning of the Agreement, without reservations and/or exceptions;<br>- Unconditionally accepted all the terms of the Agreement, without any reservations and exceptions, and undertakes to comply with them;<br>- Has no objection to the terms of use of the Site (or its individual provisions);<br>- Is of legal age and capable."
